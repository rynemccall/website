title: About me
---
I'm a Senior Software Engineer with FlipKey. (FlipKey is wholly owned by TripAdvisor.) At FlipKey, I help to build a vacation rental marketplace that connects millions of travelers with over 300,000 rental homes. Life is never dull for a developer at FlipKey; I develop across the entire stack, writing code in Python, PHP, JavaScript, and .NET.

Before coming to FlipKey, I worked for Tekelec in Raleigh, NC, developing tools to automate the testing of Tekelec's custom Linux platform. At Tekelec, I gained a deep appreciation for using open source software as the foundation for successful products.

I graduated from North Carolina State University in 2009 with degrees in Computer Engineering and Economics. After a few years in industry, I returned to school and graduated with a Masters in Business Administration from Elon University in 2013.
